**"YOUTH BANK & MONEY MANAGEMENT"**


A Youth Bank is a financial institution that focuses on providing banking services tailored to young people. It aims to educate youths about money management, savings, and responsible spending. These banks often offer special accounts with features like low fees, budgeting tools, and financial literacy programs. By engaging with a Youth Bank, young individuals can develop essential skills for managing their finances effectively, establishing healthy financial habits from an early age. Such initiatives play a crucial role in empowering the youth to make informed decisions about money, setting them on a path toward financial independence and stability.
